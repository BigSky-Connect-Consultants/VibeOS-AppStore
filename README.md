  **IMPORTANT**: Your PR must be *well tested* on your own VibeOS instance first. This is the mandatory first step for your submission.

Thank you!

## Third-Party AppStores

VibeOS uses the same package standard as CasaOS, which allows you to customize your instance using a variety of third-party app stores. Below, you'll find a collection of third-party app store links that you can add to your VIbeOS instance to expand your app selection and enhance your user experience. 

Simply copy the provided source link and add it to your VibeOS settings to access the corresponding app store.
